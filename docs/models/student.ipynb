                "\n",
                "1. **Student Uniqueness**: Both `registration_number` and `roll_number` must be unique. Email must also be unique.\n",
                "2. **Enrollment Relationship**: Each student can have only ONE current enrollment (OneToOne relationship).\n",
                "3. **Guardian Flexibility**: One guardian can be associated with multiple students (ManyToMany relationship).\n",
                "4. **Enrollment Status Tracking**: Any change to enrollment status should create an EnrollmentHistory record for audit trail.\n",
                "5. **Grade Options**: SubjectResult supports both marks-based and grade-based evaluation. Either can be null/blank.\n",
                "6. **Attempt Types**: SubjectResults can be marked as 'regular' or 're_exam' to track re-examination attempts.\n",
                "7. **Academic Record**: One student can have multiple academic records (one per semester).\n",
                "8. **Document Storage**: Student documents are stored in 'student_documents/' directory.\n",

                "#### 1. **Enrollment Model Design Flaw**\n",
                "**Issue**: Using `OneToOneField` for student enrollment is problematic. Students typically enroll in multiple programs/semesters over time.\n",

                "\n",
                "**Recommendations**:\n",
                "- Add date validation (enrollment_date should not be in future for Student)\n",
